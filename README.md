This is my project for course SAL (multi-valued logic applications), where I tried to train a CNN network to classify simple shapes (line, square, triangle). I created functions that generate these random shapes 
and then I tried to find some model, that could learn how to recognize them, but I was unable to find the right parameters in order to get good accuracy of classifications.
